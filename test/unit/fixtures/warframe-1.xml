	Just a feedback for Gauss Augment. Since his gameplay has been around "banging the wall".
</p>

<p>
	Adding Slide Drift would be good. Make sure it's an exilus, since it doesn't affect damage.

      <title>Ability to recast Warcry as Valkyr</title>
      <link>https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1133958-ability-to-recast-warcry-as-valkyr/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>
	Far too many times do I cast Warcry with Eternal War equipped, kill a bunch of enemies and get to 50 second duration, and then a bug occurs where my teammates will lose their Warcry while I still have mine. This forces me to either fall off the map, walk into a nullifier, or just wait out the 50 seconds before I can help my team again. Please allow us to recast Warcry to make it a lot easier for Valkyrs to keep supporting their teammates.

        <![CDATA[<p>
	So I'm not sure how many will agree with me here, but personally I feel Loki NEEDS a rework. His abilities haven't changed since day one (and he's one of the original eight) and I only ever see Loki players use two of his abilities: Invisibility and Radial Disarm. Decoy doesn't have much use and Switch Teleport is completely useless. If a frame is going to get another rework, it should be Loki.

	Gara deserves a small tweak that should have been a part of her prime.
</p>

<p>
	When your trying to stack damage onto splinter you have to be OUTSIDE the mass vitrify wall.   The wall explodes outwards so it does make a little sense that you have to be in the path of the shards to absorb them.   But then again....if your standing on the outside and smash the wall why doesnt it explode inward?????
</p>

<p>
	-Gara should get the damage stacking bonus if she breaks the wall from the INSIDE of the wall...   (would also be awesome if you didnt have to be in physical lash distance, if just casting lash made the wall break)
</p>

<p>
	-In a perfect world her wall would explode outward AND get sucked into the center to make a broken glass cyclone for just a second.   Killing the enemies who you glassed over while casting her 4.
</p>

<p>
	Its just super freaking wierd having to break her wall from the outside to stack damage.
</p>

<p>
	PS: its been brought up before but  Gara walls on Helene/Sedna do not use your energy colors.  The walls are orange and impossible to see through.

      <title>A suggestion for Vaubans Bastille/Vortex</title>
      <link>https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1266593-a-suggestion-for-vaubans-bastillevortex/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>
	Currently, Vaubans 4 has 2 abilities tied to it.<br /><strong>Bastille</strong>, which causes enemies to be excluded from an area, and ...<br /><strong>Vortex</strong> which causes enemies to be drawn to an area.<br />
	So far, so good as both are useful tactics.
</p>

<p>
	<br />
	The problem comes <u><em>when a Bastille ends, as it then draws enemies into the area it was formerly excluding them from</em></u>. This is problematic as it pulls things like parasitics/energy leeches/nullifiers directly into the former safe zone and right on top of anyone having taken shelter there. As a side note, it's impossible to cast a bastille and then a vortex as the key combination to do so collapses the existing bastille into a vortex ( or vice versa, depending on your hold/tap settings ). The utility of collapsing a bastille into a vortex is nice, so having to take a moment to plan your cast order strategy is suitable for Vauban. It's workable though not perfect but needed to be pointed out.<br /><em><strong>Having the bastille AUTOMATICALLY collapse into a vortex is not good and should be removed. </strong></em>Thanks for looking out for us and trying to automate it, but it mixes the two intents and causes more problems than it solves in my experience.
</p>

<p>
	Also, while Vaubans Endless Vortex augment allows you to stack duration on your vortex it does not allow you to stack duration on your bastille in the same manner. In tandem with the overloaded key issues mentioned above it's overly complicated to maintain a bastille while maintaning a vortex.<br />
	Please expand it's abilities to include throwing a bastille into a bastille in the same manner and with the same duration ratio increase.<br />
	 Hm, now that I think about it, it would be nice to be able to expand the augment to include any of his abilities being cast ontop of each other to combine timers in this manner.... That might be OP though. <span>:)</span>
</p>

<p>
	Thanks!
</p>

<p>
	PS - forum post TAGS should not be mandatory.

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Lavos has some new mechanics, a new style of play, and a lot of adaptable skills for you to experiment with. Lavos does not use energy in the same way as other Warframes, and his abilities have some nuance that is important to learn while mastering!
</p>

<p>
	<strong>PASSIVE</strong><br>
	Energy and Universal Orbs give Lavos status immunity for 10 seconds. Hold any Ability to imbue the next cast with additional Elemental Damage and Status.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>OPHIDIAN BITE</strong><br>
	Lash out with a toxic serpentine strike, consuming the target to heal Lavos. Hold to imbue all Abilities with Toxin.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>VIAL RUSH</strong><br>
	Dash forward, crashing through enemies and leaving an icy trail of broken vials. Hold to imbue the next Ability cast with Cold.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>TRANSMUTATION PROBE</strong><br>
	Launch a probe that converts Health and Energy Orbs into Universal Orbs that provide both, and Ammo pickups into Universal Ammo Pickups. The probe shocks enemies in close proximity. Each electrocuted foe reduces Ability cooldowns by one second. Hold to imbue the next Ability cast with Electricity.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>CATALYZE</strong><br>
	Catalyst Probes erupt from Lavos and douse combatants in a fiery gel. Damage is doubled for each element afflicting an enemy. Hold to imbue the next Ability cast with Heat.
</p>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>
	I've been playing Gauss a bit, and while i REALLY enjoy him a lot, it's sometimes a little annoying that he can only ever dash forward, it works nicely for melee but for gunplay you don't always want to just go forward. I was thinking that maybe an augment could be made (possibly exilus) that lets him dash in all directions with Mach Rush, but in turn disables his Mach Rush sprint. Omni directional dashing would be powerful, but the disabled sprint makes it so it's not just a no-brainer, and it would alter the way he's played and modded, which i think could be very interesting. <br /><br />
	Any thoughts on this?

      <title>Chroma needs a rework</title>
      <link>https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1266576-chroma-needs-a-rework/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>
	<strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Chroma was really good before recent updates, especially before self-damage removal, but now he's outdated and the roles he would play in the past are filled by other warframes, he's basically a niche frame. In the past, he was good at Eidolon hunting, but now you just can't use him if you're going for a meta squad as his Vex armor Fury buff takes too long to build up, we can't forget that his tanking abilities are no longer good, especially when you're talking about Steel Path. Really, the only use for him right now is to clear the starchart, fight the Profit Taker and play casual 1x3. So now, I am giving suggestions to make him good again and hopefully DE will see this.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Passive</strong>
</p>

<p>
	For his passive, I don't see any problems on it. The plus mobility is nice, the parkour on Gas City that is so hard for other frames is a walk in the park for Chroma.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>1st Ability: Spectral Scream</strong>
</p>

<p>
	This ability is quite nice to use on low level enemies (1-50), but when you're doing sorties or you're on the Steel Path, it's just unusable. Yes, the chain effect that was implemented greatly increases its power, but it's just not enough. So here are the suggestions: Now, scaling with power strength, this ability will strip armor, not depending on element; varying with enemy quantity, this ability will increase it's power with a damage multiplier (<strong>unscalable</strong>), this will make a great synergy with Vauban's Vortex, Nidus' Larva or other grouping abilities.
</p>

<p>
	<span><strong><span>2nd Ability: Elemental Ward</span></strong></span>
</p>

<p>
	<span><span>Now, this is where the fun begins. This ability is one of the best in terms of utility and tankiness; the fact that it's a Helminth ability, makes it even more amazing, especially when you apply it to Hildryn, Inaros and Nidus. But the the problem here is with Chroma, the main problem is that EHP turns into trash if you don't have a healing ability, like Devour. My main suggestion for this ability is that <strong>Heat</strong> will now <strong><u><em>restore</em></u></strong> your health or <u><em><strong>life steal</strong></em></u> (based on weapon's damage ofc), scaling with power strength. If you watch Grind Hard Squad, you probably saw that his Chroma would only work with Arcane Grace (he was still soft), but things changed when Gloom came out as a Helminth ability, the main focus for the Chroma build was the <u><em><strong>life steal</strong></em></u> as there's a great synergy with his Vex armor, because of it's damage increase. Other buffs would be: shield restoration with electricity and more shields (since they're useless) and <u><em><strong>fire rate</strong></em></u> with toxin.</span></span>
</p>

<p>
	<strong>3rd Ability: Vex Armor</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Ok, this ability is the other one that make Chroma shine. It's amazing when when it comes to take down big tanky enemies and other little ones. But here's the bad part, as I said before, This ability takes way too long to build. The main solutions i could think of were: making the buff instant, swap Fury for shields and Scorn for health (I especially don't like this one) and, my favorite, adding a <strong><em><u>Signature</u></em></strong> secondary weapon, this might sound weird, but let me explain. For each shot to an enemy, this ability will take 10 health out of you, you need 100 health lost for max fury, hence you will need to shoot 10 times.
</p>

<p>
	ATTENTION: This MUST work on invincible enemies like the Eidolons when shields are up, otherwise this weapon is strait-up trash as this rework for Vex armor is focused on Eidolon hunt.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>4th Ability: Effigy</strong>
</p>

<p>
	This ability is the main reason why people use Chroma for Profit Taker fight, the other is Elemental Ward and Vex Armor, but outside of that single fight, it is completely <strong><em><s><u>garbage </u></s></em></strong>. Here's the suggestion I've come up with: Now, Effigy will become a "guardian", just like Stardust Guardian from Terraria (google it). Depending on Chroma's current element, this ability will make enemies have a 10%/15% chance to drop a health orb (<strong>unscalable</strong>) for heat element; increase shield restoration for each enemy killed (<strong>with a cap</strong>); nothing for cold (unless you think of something) for cold, as it would be a little too op to have even more armor increase and, finally, enemies' guns have a chance to stop working, ammo efficiency and/or +fire rate for toxin, (bonus credit will apply to all of them). I personally think it would fit well for effigies theme (check trivia section on Chroma's article on wiki). One more thing, i decided to give them all a fixed range of 10m, as Chroma need on most of the builds high duration, high strength, low range and efficiency, with an exception being toxin, with a fixed range of 20m.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>

<p>
	So yeah, give more suggestions on the comments, I hope DE will see this post, like it if you want these changes too (no beg), I'll be upset if I wrote this in vain. And for fashion's sake make Chroma change his emissive and energy colors as you change your elements mid-mission, I'm fund of seeing orange ice. <span>:D</span>

      <title>Nidus parasitic link idea, involving mutation stacks</title>
      <link>https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1266461-nidus-parasitic-link-idea-involving-mutation-stacks/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>
	First, i want to talk about frost, ember, saryn, oberon and volt augments they have for their first abilities wich grants elemental aditional bonus damage to guns, based on a % from the weapon (base/current i don't know) damage.
</p>

<p>
	And i was thinking, if a viral version comes true, i want it to be on our virulent infested boy, But the augment will work as this:
</p>

<p>
	While linked to an ally: Every ally between 40m at base from Nidus OR the linked ally will have for the duration of this link <u><em>(similar to equinox day form 3rd ability,this includes maggots and pets, getting out/in will turn on/off the buff except nidus or his ally since it would cancel the link)</em></u> the next buff:
</p>

<p>
	Bonus 50% Viral damage of base damage for weapons, companions and maggots(on maggots will be current damage but i'll explain this later) while this 50% will increase based on power strengh, will have NO duration timer since is tied to the link duration. And the Second and INTERESTING part of this, is that this augment includes a 1 <strong>FLAT </strong>bonus adittive viral damage that will increased based on<strong> MUTATION STACKS</strong>, so at 100 stacks we will have 101 bonus viral damage, and this will be able to enhace on maggots by the 50% at base (if we made the mathematic for 100% strengh and 100 stacks, maggots can get a 101 x 1.5 = 151.5 bonus viral damage, added to the sad 10 toxin damage that can increase to 15 because of the 50% bonus, so 151.5+15 =166.1) and maybe, this flat value affects abilities as well (even pets abilites)
</p>

<p>
	Very interesting doesn't it?
</p>

<p>
	the sad part is that in my current build i cant make room for this slot so i'd maybe loose so much potential q-q
</p>

<p>
	but atleast would be fun idk
</p>

<p>
	AND While linked to an enemy:
</p>

<p>
	Allies between 20m at base, whenever the link exist, from nidus or his linked enemy, will Heal for 15 health per second that will scale with strengh, and 1% Max health that will be increased to another 1%Max Health for every 10 mutation stacks (or 0.5% every 5 stacks), so 11% max health/s at 100stacks, BUT after 100 stacks it will add 1% after 20 stacks instead of 10, so 16%Max health regen at 200 stacks and 21% at 300 stacks. (since it'll work based on stats, this will not be affected by strengh)
</p>

<p>
	i'd like if this augment has little black spores flying around the body of affected allies as visual effect, or maybe nothing since some people dont like too much visual effects
</p>

<p>
	However , i'm confident about this idea to be something that wouldn't be really broken, and is interesting enough to be implemented.
</p>

<p>
	Is not a "must" bandaid augment, is for variety of playstyles, and this is good for pet-lovers playstyle, and gives parasitic link finally a good reason to have mutation stacks AND keep them up, since people tent to have 15 or a bit more and stay like that because they only use it for the undying pasive, 1st and 4th(only damage) synergys with stacks aren't really interesting for casual nidus players (me not included since i usually use the 1st as my main source of damage + his 4, but other people just care about his 2 and tankiness), so this augment would bennefit everyone <strong>BUT AT THE COST OF AN IMPORTANT SLOT</strong>, but i'd take the risk

	Nidus is the onlyone that has 115% strengh without mods. And his Parasitic Link does well with power stengh themed warframe.
</p>

<p>
	I'll take the risk to say confidently that nidus IS the power stengh warframe. but he has that one ability that will not scale with it. He's Larva (the 2nd ability)
</p>

<p>
	My idea is to give it 1m "punch through" by every 100% power strengh, while it be ¡0 at base! so you would need 200% power strengh to have 1m, an nidus being the only one who could use it with 0.15m punchthrough without mods.

	<strong>(i have to leave this clear, i dont say i want larva to detect more enemies through walls, IT ALREADY DOES THAT, i want this to atleast make them go to the larva center)</strong>
</p>

<p>
	•First: this punchthrough means the distance an enemy can travel through walls (i very very often sees enemies stuck between structures).
</p>

<p>
	•It wouldn't give damage at all, so this will NOT break helminth system, and if this worries you, helminth larva has reduced range (you wouldn't have 1m range without atleast 2 mods anyway and blind rage has a huge downside by its own)
</p>

<p>
	•Nidus needs to kill enemies on larva to cast it again so this is pretty much needed
</p>

<p>
	•This fits nidus power strengh theme well (i love his kind of theme like corrupted mods, he has no shields/shield gating but has a bit more of power strengh)
</p>

<p>
	<strong>I also saw a cool idea at another time:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	If parasitic link could "link" buffs (like, if the ally has roar on him and/or xata's whisper i would like to have it too, or share him my Teeming virulence and end this buff duration whenever the link expires(even if the buff last longer than this link, maybe a nullifier spawned in my face or something))
</p>

<p>
	i dont really know if this last one is probable to happen, but the first one i see it as a must Q-Q a really painful must
</p>

<p>
	edit: no, is not good enough to waste it on an augment, non of both ideas, even if it's exilus, this has to be at base nidus

      <title>Hydroid suggestions (Revision 2)</title>
      <link>https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1262468-hydroid-suggestions-revision-2/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>
	<strong>Goals</strong>
</p>

<p>
	I want to make Hydroid more mobile and group-friendly, give him more AoE damage and control, more synergy between his abilities, and reduce energy costs.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<strong>Passive</strong>
</p>

<p>
	On slam attacks and explosions (Blast element, maybe) on puddles of water created by Tempest Barrage and Tidal Surge (more on this later), the water will be splashed to deal damage to enemies in a small radius around the impact. Damage of water puddles is listed in Tempest Barrage and scales with Ability Strength. No longer summons tentacles.
</p>

<p>
	Notes - puddles of water will be a new mechanic I want to introduce to Hydroid. I want it slam attacks to play into it, so Tentacle Swarm will be Hydroid's only way to summon tentacles.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<strong>Tempest Barrage</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Uses tap / hold mechanic. Tap to deal a single big hit with a form of cc. Either forced Impact status, knockdown, stun, or something. Both tap and hold versions will leave a pool of water on the ground for 3 seconds.  Hold version does not cause cc. Deals hits every second so in practice the puddle will last for the entire duration of Tempest Barrage plus 3 seconds. <em>Edit</em>: Can be cast during Tidal Surge. Hold version is centered around Hydroid. Water puddles also disables enemy movement abilities like MOA's jumps, Grineer Flameblade and Manics teleports, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Energy cost is 25 for both versions.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Augment</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Will reduce a small percentage of armour from enemies every second while standing in the puddle of water. Percentage increased by Ability Strength. Armour reduction will be lost upon leaving the water. <em>Edit</em>: Splashes of water caused by slam attacks and explosions will also apply a stack of armour reduction.
</p>

<p>
	Notes - I moved the passive's cc functionality to tap Tempest Barrage. I'd rather not have hold Tempest Barrage cause cc because Hydroid already has Tentacle Swarm for that so I felt it would be redundant.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<strong>Tidal Surge</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Hydroid turns into a mass of water. Will last until casted again and has energy upkeep cost (the way Undertow functions). In addition to its current functions, Hydroid is able to sprint, slide, jump, and bullet jump during Tidal Surge. Has self heal. Able to press primary fire to grab and enemy and pull them towards Hydroid (Undertow's function). Tidal Surge leaves puddles of water as Hydroid moves around. If equipped with Tempest Barrage's augment, the puddles of water left by Tidal Surge will also have its function.
</p>

<p>
	Energy cost is 10 on cast and 3 per second upkeep.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Augment</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Must touch allies directly to apply the augment's effect to them, not with puddles of water.
</p>

<p>
	Notes - I wanted to combine Tidal Surge and Undertow. I also want to make Tidal Surge more mobile.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<strong>Barnacles</strong> (replaces Undertow)
</p>

<p>
	Can be cast during Tidal Surge. Hydroid covers all enemies around him in barnacles for a duration. Damaging enemies covered in barnacles will duplicate the damage and divide it evenly among all enemies in a small radius around it. Duplicated damage will inherit the original attack's damage types and elements but will not inflict status ailments.
</p>

<p>
	If barnacled enemies also touches puddles of water created by Tempest Barrage and Tidal Surge, the barnacles will absorb the water and apply it to enemies as long as the barnacles stick to them. In this state, attacking barnacled enemies will also cause Hydroid's passive water splash.
</p>

<p>
	Energy cost is 50.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Augment</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Allies will also be covered in barnacles, healing them a little per second for the duration.
</p>

<p>
	Notes - I personally don't like that Undertow prevents allies from attacking enemies inside Undertow and that Hydroid himself is not able to attack enemies inside Undertow so I decided to replace it with a new ability. Plus I want to Hydroid to cover everyone in barnacles. <em>Edit</em>: barnacles will not duplicate damage from water splashes.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<strong>Tentacle Swarm</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Uses tap / hold mechanic. Tap summons a single big tentacle which performs a full circle sweep that grabs all enemies in reach then slams them down on one spot. Hold uses the original hold function. Tentacle slams counts as slam attacks in regards to Hydroid's passive. Can be cast during Tidal Surge, will use Hydroid's position as the center of casting.
</p>

<p>
	Energy cost is 50 for tap, 75 for hold.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Augment</strong>
</p>

<p>
	If using the tap version, the effect applies on enemies while grabbed by tentacle and for 5 seconds after the slam.
</p>

<p>
	Notes - Yes, if enemies are barnacled with water absorbed, enemies will be splashed twice.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	I'm not good with numbers, so the numbers are not final and are left to people who are better and more experienced at balancing them. I welcome feedback so that we can make Hydroid the best he can be.
</p>

			<strong>Goals</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			I want to expand on Hydroid's control style. I think he needs bigger AoE on his abilities, faster casting, and be more group-friendly.
		</p>

		<p>

		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Tempest Barrage</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			Uses the tap / hold mechanic. Tap Tempest Barrage changed to dealing a large single hit.
		</p>

		<p>

		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Tidal Surge</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm thinking of giving Tidal Surge the ability to self-heal so that Hydroid can self-heal without an augment.
		</p>

		<p>

		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Undertow</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			Make the radius a lot bigger. I'm thinking of around 15 meters at base. Enemies caught will have the lower half of their body sink into the ground, allowing other players to hit the enemies. Enemies will be slowed down by 50% while in Undertow. Undertow will pull enemies toward the middle while active.
		</p>

		<p>
			Edit: Undertow will disable enemies' movement abilities like Moa's jump, Manic's teleports, etc.
		</p>

		<p>

		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Tentacle Swarm</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			Uses the tap / hold mechanic. Increase the hold radius to 20 meters.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>
	I was listening to music from Bleach and I was playing Excalibur using his exalted blade and it made me want to put up this post of a rework for him.
</p>

<p>
	If I were to rework him here is what I would do.
</p>

<p>
	I know this doesn`t fit his theme but for fun`s sake listen to this while you read this.

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<strong>Excalibur:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Passive improvement:</strong> Increase the percentage of damage bonus to 25% and attack speed bonus to 15% (his passive at this moment is not noticeable)
</p>

<p>
	·       Make two-handed katana included with the passive.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<strong>1st ability:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	·       It has the combo multiplier window. (the more you use it the less energy it takes, the more damage it does)
</p>

<p>
	·       It has a 50% chance to proc slash and the damage is based on the combo window.
</p>

<p>
	·       Increase the base damage to 600.
</p>

<p>
	·       After it makes contact with an enemy, enemies with a 10m radius of that enemy will be targeted.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<strong>2nd ability:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	·       (synergy) enemies affected will take more damage from his 1st, 3rd and 4th ability.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<strong>3rd ability Rework:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Excalibur will summon holographic armour around himself to protect himself from damage, giving him 50% damage reduction and can reflect incoming damage back at enemies while blocking.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	·       The ability lasts for 20 seconds and can be increased by duration mods.
</p>

<p>
	·       While active it will absorb damage from enemies` attacks. When ability ends, the absorbed damage will convert into extra armour.
</p>

<p>
	·       The max amount of armour you can receive is 600 depending on the amount of damage absorbed.
</p>

<p>
	·       The extra armour will last 15 seconds and can be increased by duration mods.·       Deactivating the ability will shoot the armour outwards dealing the accumulated damage at enemies. If enemies survive, they will receive a stagger proc and it will make them susceptible to melee damage by 30%.
</p>

<p>
	·       The blocking reflected damage is based on power strength and the melee combo counter.
</p>

<p>
	·       The ability cast animation is Excalibur in a guard stance.
</p>

<p>
	·       Armour colour will be affected by chosen energy colour.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<strong>4th ability:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	•                Get rid of mini 2nd ability. (waste of energy)
</p>

<p>
	•                It can block 100% damage.
</p>

<p>
	•                The first charge attack is vertical slash and the second is a horizontal slash.
</p>

<p>
	•                Change it back to look like an energy sword like it was before (there was no reason to change it in the first place).
</p>

<p>
	•                Preforming a ground slam will visually look like radial javelins.
</p>

<p>
	Fix: Put Excalibur`s energy channel glow back the way it was like nyx`s
</p>

<p>
	(the way it is now is just ugly).
</p>

	Teleportation is based on sight and memory, as long as you can see what is in front of you or if you remember a location by memory, you can teleport there.
</p>

<p>
	That being said there are warframes with teleport abilities that don`t 100% follow this idea and is very limited.

      <title>Equinox Night Form is Terrible and not just because Gloom Makes it Irrelevant.</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>
	Hello,
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Gloom (seriously, who designed this ability?) is literally the best of both Peaceful Provocation on Night and Mend at the same time, except more convenient because it doesn't require you to take damage, heals you instantly instead of requiring a clunky recast, can be used on any frame and, most importantly, isn't two separate drains. This is not the only ability that has completely outclassed aspects of Equinox Night Form's kit. Baruuk's Lull provides a slow and a sleep effect in a larger are of effect. Moreover, Baruuk brings things to the table both Equinox forms could only dream of, being incredibly tanky with Desolate Hands and having one of the most powerful exalted weapons in the game in Desert Wind. If for some reason you don't want these traits, you can use Lull on literally any frame you want. Maybe consider buffing Mend so that it provides lifesteal in its radius to allies while active or maybe give it a heal over time that scales in some way with damage accumulated. This would only be a start, though. Overall, Equinox has always been a very interesting, but poorly designed and clunky frame, especially its Night Form, and needs a rework to its overall functionality. Will this actually happen though? Doubt it. Maybe in another 3-5 years we may see a new band aid augment. Or maybe Equinox will become meta in the new Archwing-Necramech-Pinball-Arcade game mode, so why bother changing it. Unless Equinox play rate skyrockets or a dozen sick Equinox tennogen skins get released in a row, who at DE will be compelled to give a damn? F*cking hell...

        <![CDATA[<p>
	Hello
</p>

<p>
	Can we please get a metamorphosis option outside of missions, like in the orbiter, relays and dojos. Or a option to stay in day or night through the arsenal and remove the energy color start. This makes choosing a certain color a bit difficult, and it will probably give us more of a option fashion wise.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks in advance <span class="ipsEmoji">😋</span>

      <title>Gara QoL changes</title>
      <link>https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1266375-gara-qol-changes/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>
	Gara is a really clunky warframe to use IMO, because of the several layers of tedium she has. Here are several QoL changes that I think she could really use and benefit from.
</p>

<p>
	1. Just let her refresh her 2 simply by hold-pressing it. Having to cast her 4 to refresh it is energy-hungry and very flow-breaking because of it's long cast time, movement locking, and having to turn off the expansion instead of waiting out however much duration it has.
</p>

<p>
	2. You can cast her 2 on multiple things, HOWEVER, the countdown only shows it for the last one you cast, there should be a timer as part of the bottom-right UI element that represents the duration left on it from the one cast on yourself.
</p>

<p>
	3. Gara's 1's hold mechanic has questionable verticality to it, much like Lavos' 4 used to have.
</p>

<p>
	4. Turn Gara's 1's hold into a one-handed ability so it doesn't prevent movement.
</p>

<p>
	5. Currently, mass vitrify only adds damage to your Splinter Storm if you cast your 1 on the OUTSIDE, why? Please let it work regardless of being inside or outside

	 Since Mag got her cinematic [bullet reflector] Magnetized ability added in Update 29 (Deimos), it's only fair now to bring up/implement Volt's cinematic shock ability too (for posterity).
</p>

<p>
	Long story short,  When are we getting 'Sith Lord [Lightning] Volt?'  We've seen in it during the [Alad V] Profit Cinematic (2013)<br /><img alt="giphy.gif" class="ipsImage" data-ratio="56.25" height="270" width="480" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WhfYqsYsMFW0hvmeUf/giphy.gif" /></p>

<p>
	This was again showcased in the Awakening Cinematic (July 6, 2019)

<p>
	It's time to 'complete' the (cinematic) new player experience with what they see in the Awakening is what you can actually do with these (starter) Warframes <span class="ipsEmoji">🤩</span><span class="ipsEmoji">💖</span>

	Splinter storm can cast for all unit so if you want to cast for yourself, you must see somewhere that no one be. I usually look up or down
</p>

<p>
	There was similar ability Spellbind.
</p>

<p>
	It received utility buff that hold cast for self-buff

	I want this one for Splinter storm too

      <title>Nyx Augment/Reworks</title>
      <link>https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1266289-nyx-augmentreworks/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>
	First thing first, i used to play too much with Nyx, however it's a very meh warframe. It's a cool concept but doesn't go beyond that, a cool idea non-applied... Anyway.
</p>

<p>
	Passive: Everytime an enemy is hit by Nyx's abilities, it drops an Psychic Shard. Psychic Shards stack up x% or +x over armor and shield.
</p>

<p>
	<br />
	1. The first ability. "Nyx invades the psyche of a target, confusing enemies and making them fight for the Tenno cause. Targets then fired upon by Nyx receive a damage multiplier."<br />
	Ok, cool, nice, but doesn't help you whatsoever, even with a 1000% multiplier the damage is negligenciable, if the Mind Controlled enemy manage to hit the target.<br />
	What i propose: Nyx can physically invades the target psyche, controlling it directly or indirectly, if the player choose so. Not fighting for the Tenno, but being directly controlled by the Tenno. Could have the same damage multiplier, however it waits the timer to transport the player to the driver seat of the enemy. And as the enemy, the tenno can walk everywhere and do everything except shoot another enemies, or they will attack back.<br /><br />
	2. Could be reworked like this: Has 4 functions, first a sleep skill, a "forget" skill, an order.<br />
	sleep makes everything in x radius sleep of course. the forget skill make everything in x radius forget you and allies for a x times, stunning what was hit before. the order skill make enemies go to certain places, orderly.<br /><br />
	3. When Chaos is casted, enemies will began to create an Chaotic Environment, that will develop into a mist, and Nyx prey in this chaotical environment, getting less visible and more lethal. Chaos doesn't uses timers anymore, it is reliant on Nyx energy pool.<br /><br />
	4. This is the one i want to rework or add a augment.<br /><br />
	The Augment/Rework would be like that: Nyx gets a pair of Exalted Weapons, that could be a dual sword, sparring, or claws class, or even tonfas. This weapon is psychically attuned to the enemies it faces, growing stronger as the enemies. However when feeding itself from the Psychic Shards, the skill gets a bonus of 10% strength and 20% efficiency when the shards deplets.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>
	This idea came up to me last night when I'm trying to sleep , so...
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<strong>Concept <span>:</span></strong>
</p>

<p>
	This rework idea is base on Frost , as a frost mage , manipulating environmental temperature to empower himself while make his enemies freeze .
</p>

<p>
	So first of all , I actually didn't came up with this idea myself , it was from Youtuber " Brozime " . At least I first saw this idea in his video .
</p>

<p>
	My brain took this idea , and secretly organize them into a full rework idea , than shove them into my brain when I'm trying to sleep . (Thanks brain )
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<strong>Stats <span>:</span></strong>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Base energy increase from 100 to 150 , for both version ( 225 at max rank )
</p>

<div class="ipsSpoiler" data-ipsspoiler="">
	<div class="ipsSpoiler_header">
		<span>Spoiler</span>
	</div>

	<div class="ipsSpoiler_contents">
		<p>
			He's a frost mage , 150 energy is just... super low .
		</p>

		<p>
			Even for some one who doesn't think ma energy really matter ( like me ) , it's too low .
		</p>

		<p>
			This small buff to stats should make a nice QoL change .
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<strong>Passive <span>:</span></strong>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Frost will have 2 passive <span>:</span></span>
</p>

<p>
	1.
</p>

<p>
	Cold proc will gain 1 extra stack when they're appiled .
</p>

<div class="ipsSpoiler" data-ipsspoiler="">
	<div class="ipsSpoiler_header">
		<span>Spoiler</span>
	</div>

	<div class="ipsSpoiler_contents">
		<p>
			So if his weapon have cold damage , when they proc , instead of 1 cold stack , it will be 2 .
		</p>

		<p>
			Just some simple stuff . It's more about flavor than actual function .
		</p>

		<p>

		</p>

		<p>
			Also all his ability already took this into account , so when you see something like " applied 6 cold proc " , it's actually applying 5 + 1 passive cold proc .
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	2.
</p>

<p>
	The lower the temperature around frost , the stronger he gets , grants him extra armor and power strength .
</p>

<p>
	There will be a indicator to show how cold the environment is .
</p>

<div class="ipsSpoiler" data-ipsspoiler="">
	<div class="ipsSpoiler_header">
		<span>Spoiler</span>
	</div>

	<div class="ipsSpoiler_contents">
		<p>
			Now this is the actual passive .
		</p>

		<p>
			Like I state before , environment temperature is a big part of this kit .
		</p>

		<p>

		</p>

		<p>
			The temperature will start at normal , and while frost cast his abilities , the area being effected will become colder and colder , till a certain point . ( will be indicated as percentage , and 100% being the coldest point .)
		</p>

		<p>
			And while his in those area , his armor and power strength will increase , end at maximum of 1500 extra armor and 50% more strength .
		</p>

		<p>
			Which is nice , since those 2 stats matter's a lot .
		</p>

		<p>
			Enemies will become slower while in those area , the colder it is  , the slower they are .
		</p>

		<p>
			The temperature will slowly raised back to normal , so maintaining  a cold environment around Frost will be important .
		</p>

		<p>

		</p>

		<p>
			Other than the "cold bar " UI , the area will also be covered in ice as the temperature drop , so you can see where is super cold and where needs some patch .
		</p>

		<p>

		</p>

		<p>
			It's kind of like Ember's passive , but instead of burning people , it's super cold floor .
		</p>

		<p>
			( Which is also a cool flavor ( pun not intended ), seeing two elemental caster have similar passive )
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<strong>1. Flash Freeze ( renamed ) </strong>
</p>

<p>
	Frost cast a freezing projectile , explode on impact , dealing damage and froze the target if it hits one .
</p>

<p>
	Nearby enemies took splash damage and applied 6 cold proc .
</p>

<p>
	The temperature at the impact area will lower a bit .
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	temperature decrease : 25%

<p>
	Augment : no change .
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<strong>2. Ice wave </strong>
</p>

<p>
	Send a wave of sharp ice , dealing damage and applied 6 cold proc to effected enemies .
</p>

<p>
	The ice spikes will stay for a while , dealing DoT and applied 2 extra cold proc .
</p>

<p>
	Area covered by ice will become colder over time .
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	temperature decrease : 25% on cast , 10% / s .

</p>

<p>
	Power strength ( damage )
</p>

<p>
	power duration ( Duration of ice spikes , cold proc and time between Dot + extra cold proc ) ( High duration = rapid damage + cold proc )

			Another straight buff , now also deals DoT damage .

			And a nice tool to create the perfect freezing ground .

	</div>
</div>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Augment <span>: </span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Since the environment temperature making enemies slower , which is the effect of this augment , this probably needs some changes .</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>I have no idea though , someone can came up with something.</span>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<strong>3. Snow Globe </strong>
</p>

<p>
	Basically stay the same .
</p>

<p>
	The temperature inside the globe will drastically decrease on cast , and continue to decrease over time .
</p>

<p>
	Casting 1 on it will still explode it , dealing damage and applied 6 cold proc , while also decrease nearby area's temperature equal to inside the globe .
</p>

<p>
	So if inside the globe is 80% cold , when it explode , the area around it will became 80% cold .
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	temperature decrease : 50% on cast , 10% / s .

	<div class="ipsSpoiler_contents">
		<p>
			It's the same , but add a function to also be a tool to cool the environment .
		</p>

		<p>

		</p>

		<p>
			Interestingly , thanks to his new passive , his globe will be much harder than ever .
		</p>

		<p>
			Also yes , while Frost is in his globe , he will have constant armor and strength boost .
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	Augment : no change .
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<strong>4. Avalanche </strong>
</p>

<p>
	Frost calls upon an avalanche , instantly damage and freeze all enemies around him , and decrease temperature to nearly the lowest point .
</p>

<p>
	When enemies frozen by this ability is killed , they will explode , dealing splash damage , apply 6 cold proc and lower the temperature even more .
</p>

<p>
	Frozen enemies will have their defense lowered as always , but increase from base 40% to 50% .
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	temperature lowered : 80% on cast , 25% when frozen enemies explode .
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Effected by <span>:</span>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Power strength ( Damage , armor strip . )
</p>

<p>
	Power range ( Casting range and AoE range )
</p>

<p>
	Power duration ( frozen duration )
</p>

<p>
	Efficiency
</p>

<p>

	<div class="ipsSpoiler_header">
		<span>Spoiler</span>
	</div>

	<div class="ipsSpoiler_contents">
		<p>
			It's the same avalanche , but also being the ultimate move to create a winter land .
		</p>

		<p>
			Also buff armor strip a bit , so 200% strength will be enough to completely remove them . ( Which pair with his passive , means  only 150% PS is required in build . neat ! )
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	Augment : no change .
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<strong>Conclusion <span>:</span></strong>
</p>

<p>
	<span>It's just a straight upgrade to current Frost , while having some depth in gameplay , as player needs to pay attention to how cold is him .</span>
</p>

<p>
	Also I hope those temperature thing will not be coding nightmare if this somehow comes true .
</p>

<p>
	so ... yah this is the post . Bye ~
