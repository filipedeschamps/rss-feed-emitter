	I've seen some leaked gun mods that add +300% damage so long as no melee is equipped.
</p>

<p>
	This may well just be a dev idea on the cutting room floor or fake, but just in case...
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Please, please, PLEASE don't add mods that buff guns only when no melee equipped.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	We want guns that compete with melee, not an either/or choice where you can take one or the other but not both.
</p>

<p>
	If you agree with me and want DE to know please like this post.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, I realise these mods would be useful for gun-only sortie missions and some melee-immune bosses. But if they exist then no other gun improvements can really happen without balancing for those bosses.

	I just got Combo Killer from Baro on PS4 today
</p>

<p>
	and I have to say, this mod is really Not Useful.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	if you're using a glaive the right way, you're constantly throwing and manually detonating it
</p>

<p>
	and thus gaining no combo counter anyway. At best you might be using corrupt charge to have an initial multiplier, but it'll constantly be getting drained
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	The only build Combo Killer might be usable for, is if you Never Detonate your glaive, and instead rely on the Volatile throw mods for auto-detonation. But doing this sucks because you give up too much - by never manual heavy attacking you can never use Life Strike, you no longer have the guaranteed status procs from manual detonation, etc, its not worth doing an auto-detonate build. and thus no point in bothering with Glaive Combo meters or Combo Killer.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	How to make Combo Killer useful??
</p>

<p>
	how about instead of Secondary kills resetting (preserving) the non-existant combo meter. you let Secondary hits Contribute to the combo meter.
</p>

<p>
	Then you could have an actual dual wield synergy, plus an incentive to have a viable combo counter build for glaives.
</p>

<p>
	goes like: Get a bunch of pistol kills, builds up combo counter, once a big multiplier is up, Then throw and spend it on the glaive manual detonation for an extra big boom.
</p>

<p>
	That would be great for dual-wield. gives a reason to swap back and fourth between pistol and glaive throw.

And Maybe Status Effect?</title><link>https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1265972-a-way-to-buff-guns-and-rewards-skillful-gameplay-headshots-or-weak-point-hits-should-guarantee-crits-and-maybe-status-effect/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>
	This is pretty self explanatory. I find it odd that Headshots or hitting weakpoints is much less effective than letting RNG drops you a 10x damage multiplier or 5 status proc on hitting any parts of the body. Currently in Warframe, the gameplay does not reward precision, sure there are some mods that do that but with how much powerful our mandatory mods taking space we can‚Äôt sacrifice them. What if we make precision a very rewarding part in gameplay that YOU want to aim for it. What if we make that headshots or any hit on the weakspot adds +100% Additive Critical Chance and maybe +100% additive Status Chance on the weakspot hit damage calculations? Say for example you have a weapon with these stats.
</p>

<ul><li>
		Critical Chance <span>: 10%</span>
	</li>
	<li>
		Critical Multiplier : 2.0x
	</li>
	<li>
		Status Chance <span>: 20%</span>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span>Damage : 100 (33% slash, 33% Puncture, 33% impact).</span>
	</li>
</ul><p>
	<span>If the hit was a headshot or a weak point hit, your damage will have 110% Crit Chance and +120% Status Chance. Your hit can be a yellow or orange crit and you can proc 1 or 2 status effect instantly. If you can aim, you can turn this weak stat weapon into a status or crit monster. There is also another benefit for this change, <strong>it makes mods like Point Strike, Pistol Gambit, and the status mods no longer mandatory opening up more build potential for skillful players, </strong>if you can aim you may no longer require these mods because you can just take aim. You may ask me ‚Äúwho will use these mods now?‚Äù, simple there are players who have a hard time aiming or just too lazy to aim so these mods can be just for them.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>If these changes were implemented I can see some gimmicky builds making it‚Äôs debut in the meta.</span>
</p>

<ul><li>
		<span><strong>Full on Vigilante Set Build.</strong></span>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span><strong>Utility focused weapon builds while maintaining damage potential. E.g Snipers with Sharpshooter or secondaries with Mending Shot.</strong></span>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Originally intended to be crit focused weapons, but it can proc status like crazy if you can aim and build for status.</strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Originally intended to be status weapons, but it can crit like crazy if you can aim and build for criticals.</strong>

	I feel like split flights was a great idea for a mod, but it suffers from some major usability issues. IMO, the duration is just too short in its current form. Been having a lot of fun recently with a shotgun daikyu build recently and the only reason im ever able to pass a stack of two in any situation other than with massive groups of enemies is cause i have 100+% multi on my riven. Im sure two seconds could be fine if bows weren't charge weapons, but since they are, you have to account for charge time and what's left after just isnt enough. If there isn't an enemy directly in the middle of your FoV or there are other players nearby, you can forget about maintaining your stacks.
</p>

<p>
	I propose one of two changes. The simplest would be to just increase the time you have to get a hit. Even just one more second could make a world of difference, but i feel like four would be optimal. Alternatively, you could also scale the window based on the current or base charge time of a weapon. This would give weapons like the daikyu a better chance of using the mod effectively without overshooting it for weapons like the rakta cernos. Another possibility would be to have the stacks decay one at a time like with the arca cisco's effect. This would still have some urgency, but finding another enemy to kill wouldn't be do or die like it is now.

	The combination of weak Primes and all weapons starting at .5 dispo really sucks for long time players.
</p>

<p>
	This doesn't happen with every new Prime, but it happens more and more the longer you play.
</p>

<p>
	The experience goes something like...
</p>

<p>
	- I loved the Tenora back when I first got it.
</p>

<p>
	- I got a good riven for it and grinded/rolled it better.
</p>

<p>
	- But it's still underpowered and has fallen by the way.
</p>

<p>
	- New Tenora Prime announced! Exciting <span class="ipsEmoji">üòÄ</span>
</p>

<p>
	- It comes out and I get it and...
</p>

<p>
	- It's a slight improvement on the base weapon, but not with my riven. <span class="ipsEmoji">üòû</span>
</p>

<p>
	This feels like a slap in the face - DE don't want riven price inflation and don't want power creep, I get it, but it sucks when a new variant just isn't any better than the old one.
</p>

<p>
	It takes something that would draw me back in to the game (exciting new weapon) to something that drives me away (troll! It's just the same or worse, basically a skin).
</p>

<p>
	Maybe it will be fixed with the next riven dispo round. Troll again! No it won't. Apparently the Tenora Prime somehow justifies being .5 dispo.
</p>

<p>
	Or, you know, they just don't care.
</p>

<p>
	I've talked about the Tenora Prime here, but the Astilla Prime is the same story. Most new primes are the same story.
</p>

<p>
	DE, here's how this affects you: I can't remember the last time I thought a Prime Access was worth buying. I've stopped buying them. Not because I can't afford it, not because I wouldn't buy it if there was something I wanted.
</p>

<p>
	No, I don't buy it because, even when one of <em>my top all time weapons</em> gets primed and I'd love a version of it that works in the Steel Path, <strong>I know it will be mediocre</strong>.
</p>

<p>
	Here's a guide: if the base weapon outperforms a brand new Prime variant with a decent riven then your new Prime is a waste of development time and underpowered. Make primes significant upgrades.
</p>

<p>
	That or just sell them as skins with the Prime Accessories pack. It will save us the Forma.
</p>

<p>

</p>

	Pretty straight forward, both the Astilla Prime and Volnus Prime are MR 14 weapons, which I think is the highest MR requirement for a weapon, or at least on the very high end.
</p>

<p>
	Not only do both of these weapons are easily surpassed by many weapons with far lower MR req but their stats are way too similar to the base weapons, I can hardly consider them an upgrade.
</p>

<p>
	The Astilla and Volnus direly needed a crit buff and neither of them even reach a 2.0x crit dmg multiplier. These are NOT the stats of an MR 14 weapon, and the fact that Prime Access gear lately have just been reskins of mediocre weapons is starting to feel like some lazy content. What happened to Prime weapons actually feeling special, and actually having some interesting stats or gimmicks?
</p>

<p>
	The new Prime Access weapons need a buff representative of true high level gear.

	First time?.jpg
</p>

<p>
	Anyway, here is my opinion, still not good english, so forgive me &lt;3
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Main weapon:<br />
	Rifle: Increase 1 punch through<br />
	Shotgun: Each bullet inherits weapon damage data, reduces basic damage, increases reload speed; decreases the status chance of Tigris series weapons<br />
	Bow: Increase the simultaneous firing mode (press Mouse 3 to switch), each arrow fired at the same time is counted independently; Cernos Prime cancels firing five arrows at the same time, and changes to the maximum number of fired at the same time (5); Zhuge series weapons increase Simultaneous firing mode, and maintain fully automatic firing; Nagantaka accommodates three firing modes at the same time<br />
	Sniper rifle: increase attack speed, decrease reload speed; change the zoom-in buff of Snipetron series, Vulkar series and Vectis series, from headshot damage to base damage; when Lanka zoom-in, add 1 punch through
</p>

<p>
	Secondary weapon:<br />
	Throwing weapons: Added simultaneous firing mode (press Mouse 3 to switch), each projectile fired at the same time is counted independently; detonation is changed to hold Mouse 3
</p>

<p>
	General:<br />
	Launcher (explosives): Increase the explosion range by 1.5 times, add knockback effects for explosions, add knock-off effects for direct warheads, increase base damage by 1.25 times, reduce magazine capacity, reduce loading speed and attack speed; when Opticor series weapons are installed When the explosion range is mod, expand the beam width and explosion range<br />
	Beam Held Weapon: Increase 1 range for every 1 multiple shot<br />
	Shooting weapons with projectiles: increase the projectile speed
</p>

<p>
	Specter (including Wukong and Excalibur Umbra): When using shooting weapons, the reload speed and attack speed are halved
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Reason of change: This modification aims to bring rifles, bows, shotguns, throwing weapons and beam weapons back to the audience. Only the data and part of the mechanism are modified. At the same time, the trend environment of the sniper rifle is slightly adjusted, and explosives are fired. The device is modified to a specialized use close to the one-time attack type.<br />
	At the same time, I hope to take this opportunity to deal with the problem of "shorter loading time and attack interval compared to normal usage" caused by Specter for a long time, so as to avoid abuse of Specter and related functions (such as Wukong)

<p>
	you already set a Precedent.

<p>
	Well, no one likes Zaw or Kitgun rivens either! Those weapon types just aren't relevant anymore, not with all the nerfs you put on them.

<p>
	Just look at Trade Chat, people won't even accept them as 'trash' rivens.
</p>

<p>
	So Please do the same again. Pull Zaw and Kitgun Rivens from the Sortie Reward Pool, and stick them with Simaris.

	Currently, Melee Weapons have a greater edge against guns over the following:
</p>

<ul><li>
		Most Important: a Combo System granting Melee Weapons a Damage Multiplier for Heavy Attacks
		<ul><li>
				Also, Mods that also stack different bonuses based on the Combo Counter [Weeping Wounds/Blood Rush] applied to Normal Attacks
			</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>
		Containing Mods that allow players to use them as Healing Tools [Healing Return/Life Strike]
	</li>
	<li>
		Focus System's Naramon Tree can grant Melee a decaying Combo Counter making it easier to maintain higher level Combo Bonuses
	</li>
	<li>
		No ammunition resources limiting their uses
	</li>
	<li>
		Auto-Defensive Mechanics with Parrying
	</li>
	<li>
		Stagger locking
	</li>
</ul><p>

</p>

<p>
	For some time, Snipers and a very small selection of Secondary Guns [Knell] have an inherent Combo System to them allowing each successful hit ramp up their striking power. For a while, I had thought about creating a Gun Combo System but doing so in a more balanced format. Stats that could be added to guns to sort this out could include:
</p>

<ul><li>
		<strong>COMBO DURATION - </strong>Could either make the combo counters decay or disappear after this stat is dissipated.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>COUNTER PER HIT [CPH] </strong>- How much counters a successful hit from the gun offers
		<ul><li>
				Could also make Headshots/Aimglide Shots also add bonus counters
			</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>
		<strong>COMBO BONUS </strong>- Could represent the amount of bonus offered to the gun per Combo Tier
	</li>
</ul><p>

</p>

<p>
	The only things I can see possibilities with this is much like the Melee Combo System was meant to reward use of the weapons to unleash a powerful Heavy Attack in the end, we would use a combo system for the remaining guns to reward skillful aiming/use of guns.
</p>

<p>
	Granted that this is more of a hypothetical idea and this would require a lot of work to add into, but I wanted to get this out of my chest and see how this could/can't work in Warframe.

	Hello and good day,
</p>

<p>
	Ogris has this augment mod called: Nightwatch Napalm. It is this augment that spreads fire around 90% of the explosion radius of the Ogris Rocket Launcher's blast radius of said launchers, rockets.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Nightwatch_Napalm" rel="external nofollow">https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Nightwatch_Napalm</a>
</p>

<p>
	The trouble with it is simply that it's not color customizable. I have my energy color and emissive changed to black so my rockets explode and you hardly notice the effects from it and you're not being constantly blinded by my rocket explosions. Nightwatch Napalm doesn't inherit my color options and stays the normal fire colors of orange/yellow/red and when my rockets have a radius of 13.11m it's safe to say that 90% of 13.11m is pretty sizeable. After I've fired just so many rockets, or just 1 rocket in a very tight corridor it has become view obstructing.
</p>

<p>
	For the purposes of the very extreme I have fired around 7 rockets in a 2 meter area in front of myself for prime examples of how hard it would be to see where you were going, at the extreme as I said.
</p>

	Included a shot without Nightwatch Napalm in the 3rd imgur link.

	I have all particles turned up in options, just how I like to play.
</p>

<p>
	I have Primed Firestorm on my Kuva Ogris which gives it 13.11m radius.

	I noticed that the prime version is doing less damage than the conventional weapon ... is it a bug? I have a good riven with DAM / MULT / Speed .... and even so the damage is very bad! I have all the primed mods maximized! I think there's something wrong going on! It seems that the multiple shot on this weapon does not seem to work ... or is something else that does not work!

	The new prime weapons feel underwhelming...<br />
	Volnus has a really high riven disposition since no one uses it. I don't see a reason for people to use the primed version when the rivens are so week and the stat buffs are barely considered buffs. The Astilla is in a even worse place since melee weapons have at least the mods to make them relevant while primary weapons don't. Not only it's a shotgun and <font color="#3a3a3a"><span style="background-color:rgba(238,238,238,.88);">blunderbuss is a weak mod, but there's also no internal bleeding mod for shotguns to take advantage of the</span></font><span style="background-color:rgba(238,238,238,.88);color:#3a3a3a;font-size:14px;text-align:left;"> guaranteed impact procs the weapon has. You could atleast increase the range of the explosion from 2.4 meters to at least 4m so primed firestorm is viable and we can have some fun...</span>
</p>

<p>
	Both weapons need some buffs otherwise they will remain just mediocre. This is the prime access that i was most excited about and got dissapointed really quick..

	It always feels like 90% of the time when you install a weapon exilus you have to always fix the polarity to what you actually want. Considering it already costs a forma to build one of these it's always annoying and frustrating to have to spend another one and relevel the weapon yet again just to take advantage of the slot. Please just let us choose the polarity we want when we install a weapon exilus.
