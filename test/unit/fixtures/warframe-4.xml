	Wast sure what to put in tag but nevertheless
</p>

<p>
	So I've started takeing more of a notice of my standing in focus but I must admit switching lenses is getting annoying when switching no reliable free way of getting them with out paying for the them to my knowledge mabey someone else can enlighten me on that so for me currently its basically a plat pit to throw away 80 plat a time so a suggestion would be to have a configuration A,B just 2 so DE don't lose on takeing plat form everyone at some point but this would be very grateful and useful to the players no sure why I'm asking tho lol doubt they will even read it and give it any thought but worth a try <span class="ipsEmoji">ðŸ¤£</span>

	All previous Prex cards of Warframes have their name and number (ordered by release date) in the border of the card, but Xaku's card, newly brought by Baro Ki'Teer, has neither.
</p>

<p>
	Side note, does this imply that we won't be getting a Leverian for Xaku? If that's the case it'd be a shame. Given that Xaku is a fusion of three lost frames, their backstory has a lot of potential.

	As much as I can appreciate the idea DE has going in terms of armor pieces, having so many pieces be different depending on whether you place it on the left or right leg/shoulder is a bit irritating, I'd prefer being able to pick whether I can have both be the same piece, or if I want them to be asymmetrical, in the rare cases where I think it looks good. In addition, being able to choose which side has which armor piece would be appreciated.

	<strong>Mulciber Set</strong> is hands down the <strong>best</strong> we got in a couple of years. It got me excited about Baro<br />
	again and it was worth every Ducat. And dont get me wrong, Im loving it. But given how many single piece<br />
	Shoulder Pads we have I think we could use <strong>Mirror Toggle</strong> as in:
</p>

<p>
	- If you have a Shoulder Piece you can toggle to have it in both Shoulders. <br />
	- Single Shoulder give only 1 more "Look" (Mirrored) in both Right and Left. <br />
	- Double Shoulders (like Mulciber) would actually make them more valuable as they would give<br />
	2 New "Looks" Right Mirrored, and Left Mirrored.
</p>

<p>
	This would make ALL Shoulder Pads more valuable across the board. Elevating the Worth of pretty much<br />
	half of the Armor Sets available in the game. Win win.

	Wouldn't it be great that female warframes had their own unique walking animations? For example, Wisp has a walking animation which suits her very well. But there are some warframes such as Mag, Trinity, Mirage, Nova and Nyx and more whose walking animations do not suit them well. They look masculine when they walk. In my opinion, Female warframes could have a feminine walking animation, thus, they could appeal to the eye. Is it applicable in the game?

	Right now the Smeeta Kavat has six different abilities but they all use the same symbol.

<p>
	The name is shown when the buff is applied but I would like to present some alternative symbols that could better show what each buff is doing in case you have missed the description text.
</p>

<ul><li>

	This might also apply to the normal Dera, but I do not have one of those made to test with.  I am hoping the Dera and Vandal variants, among many others will be shown love with the upcoming weapon rebalance, as I was going through some guns I haven't touched nearly enough for a while, I found that the Dera Vandal's muzzle flash is a little....dated.
</p>

<p>
	These flashes are flat, static images that rotate to meet the camera on the horizontal axis.  Not exactly up to date with the particle effects we've had for a while now.<img alt="AuOGycB.jpg" class="ipsImage" data-ratio="56.25" height="1080" width="1200" src="https://i.imgur.com/AuOGycB.jpg" /><img alt="Lq4Fi0s.jpg" class="ipsImage" data-ratio="56.25" height="1080" width="1200" src="https://i.imgur.com/Lq4Fi0s.jpg" /></p>]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">1266575</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jun 2021 12:50:13 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>QOL proposal: prime markers</title><link>https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1266563-qol-proposal-prime-markers/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>

<p>
	Baro Ki'teer just arrived, and I was having some trouble going back and forth between warframe market and the game, deciding what to give for ducats, what to sell for plat and what to keep for later use, and I had this idea, prime markers.
</p>

<p>
	You could apply them to the item by middle clicking, a small menu could open with all the personalisation options, this could also work for materials, like marking what you need to farm, but I think the main use would be marking prime parts bc there are a lot of them.
</p>

<p>
	I made 4 variants for this:
</p>

<ul><li>
		shapes and colours, which isn't so appealing (keep in mind I made this in paint tho) but gives you a lot of personalisation possibilities (and works well if you are daltonic too)
	</li>
	<li>
		just shapes, simple
	</li>
	<li>
		coloured squares, looks cleaner
	</li>
	<li>
		coloured edges, looks the best imo
	</li>
</ul><p>

	Hi, today by accident (to my completionist's despair), I discovered while you can run the Warframe Launcher as a standalone (without the need to have Steam platform running) that when you acquire a new achievement that is not related to playtime (in this example "Alchemist" for transmuting mods 10 times), it doesn't unlock itself retroactively in the Steam achievements for Warframe when playing the game after launching it though Steam platform (even though I transmuted few times after that).
</p>

<p>
	Unless I may not have triggered the event to recheck the requirement for the said achievement (if so please share how), please look into this matter.
</p>

<p>
	Also, would the remainder of the achievements have similar issues? i.e. quest, plains, and planet clear achievements.
</p>

<p>
	Thank you

	Hi.
</p>

<p>
	So i have this problem with tracking items from relics that i do not own yet. And i have this suggestion to make: a some type of a highlight (like a contour) around a relic with an unowned item/blueprint would speed up looking for missing items. Additionally, a contour around the missing item after a relic is highlighted.<br /><br />
	**Forma blueprints would perheps be best ignored**

This would allow certain abilities to pulse, like MPrime shifting between white and black or blue and white or something else for "cool" factor, but would also make various weapons obscenely more fun.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ever since I built the supra, I thought to myself "How amazing would it be to have a shifting energy color? One that just moves around the color wheel, changing every half second to second, allowing me to spew forth a myriad of color and death, giving me a dubstep gun via warframe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Really it's just for the cool/fun factor, there's no real need for this, but I'd love to see it implemented. As with the first example, it could be used to show shifting colors in abilities, or for pure hilarity.

	Why DE? Why would you do this to Ash? He literally looks like a action figure that has been put on the self and left there for years, he already got nerfed and this is just a slap to the face shown how bad the nerf was and that some ppl don`t used him anymore also he is one of the lest used warframes in 2018 even with the so called qol he got back in February. The colours look saturated and black on him makes it look grey. STOP FIXING THINK THAN AREN`T BROKEN! changes him back to the way he looked before this is not necessary! on top of that you made the hidden blades from bs change colour depending on the colour of Ash, I have a purple Ash, I don`t want by hidden blades to be purple, put it back the way it was.

	The title sums it up but to elaborate, Operators need some help. They aren't the main focus of gameplay and in a game called Warframe that's 100% fine and obvious, but as the main character of the story, the true player character, and an implied stand in for the player behind the screen, they feel very robotic and their (lack of) animations seem to me to be the cause of that. It's not that they don't have any at all- they do, and those are all very nice and expressive in relays, caputra, and the Orbiter- it's that they have zero effect on the Operator during actual missions.
</p>

<p>
	To elaborate, here is the animation selection menu: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/el5KMEc.mp4" rel="external nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/el5KMEc.mp4</a>
</p>

<p>
	Here is the Vazarin idle, demonstrated in Caputra: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8LANyqy.mp4" rel="external nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/8LANyqy.mp4</a>
</p>

<p>
	If these were indicative of how the Operators looked in mission, it would be entirely fine. They are not. Even putting aside the fact that none of them play in actual missions, the player is very likely to have an Amp equipped, and the Amp idle, itself not nearly as expressive, overrides the selected school one completely: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/MdIWTm8.mp4" rel="external nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/MdIWTm8.mp4</a>
</p>

<p>
	In a mission, either with no amp or a scanner equipped, as in the demonstration, the chosen idle is replaced with a generic one: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/K49QJSQ.mp4" rel="external nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/K49QJSQ.mp4</a> (Vazarin is equipped, but not playing)
</p>

<p>
	This stands out not only when compared to the Warframes, with their nearly 100(!!) different idle stances complete with different animations for every (ranged) weapon type (except arm cannons but that's fine), but even compared to literal robots. MOAs and Necramechs have different animation sets that affect how they move in missions.

</ul><p>
	Even in Captura, when the idles are ostensibly working properly, the different schools lack anything to truly set them apart visually. This isn't really an issue for gameplay, but it does result in every iteration of the Operator- no matter the school, animation, outfit, or amp you've chosen- feeling just about the same to play. Outside of Captura the only thing setting one apart from another is their clothing. To demonstrate, here are clips of each school's moveset (save Unairu, which I have completely neglected &lt;_&lt;):

	Instead of being the deeply customizable player avatars they seem meant to be, the lack of differentiation between any set of chosen school, stance, amp, and waybounds in the way they feel to play or even look at makes the Operator- the human heart of the story- feel more robotic than the actual, literal robot companions you can pick up along the way. Making idles work in missions would be one step, adding amp stances for each school would be another. Another still would be differentiating between each school more, but that would require more than 5 new animations and that's a bit much to ask in a feedback thread. It isn't just the idles, either- their faces never move, headtracking is disabled, animations are missing transitions... I went into more detail about the issues in a bug report thread here:

<p>
	...but the gist of it is, in a game that's otherwise so smooth to play and look at, the Operators feel like planks of wood by comparison to everything else. They need some help, and not all of it should have to wait for The Duviri Paradox, whatever that even is :p

	I make this request for three main reasons. <br /><br />
	One, just turning off the glass removal has just ruined a big thematic and aesthetic part of Gara for me. I loved how Gara and most of her cosmetics looked when the glass shattered. She still has the cast animation of her 'ripping' her glass off, and yet nothing comes of it. If doing the code for a toggle is too much then just don't do anything! On top of that now I have no idea what Gara Prime looks like without the glass. So many cool aspects of art and animation just lost for... what? People complaining about the Gara Deluxe skin?<br /><br />
	The second is because frankly I don't appreciate this 'easy way out' solution you've concocted just to appease a few loud people. You just threw away cool art assets and someone worked on, because some people think the Gara Deluxe skin looks 'ugly' in their opinion without the Glass on. You should've just either A: Addressed it and say you'll do a toggle later, or B: Do a toggle now. I know B is a bit much given Sisters of Parvos and Tennocon coming up but... seriously? This is not a great solution. <br /><br />
	Third, I know I'm not alone on this. I've been talking to friends in DM's and in Discord who are also disappointed with this change. <br /><br />
	Please just revert this. You wouldn't make Chroma keep his dragon on his body when he activates Effigy, or get rid of all the little bits and parts opening up on Gauss when he uses Redline. <br /><br />
	Please and thank you for your time.

	<span style="font-size:14pt;">There is an issue with certain warframes where certain abilities are not strong enough to interrupt enemyâ€™s movement or an animation.</span>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<b><span style="font-size:14pt;">Example 1:</span></b>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:14pt;">If Ash casts his Smoke Screen near an enemy, then teleports to it straight after it will not open it up for a finisher.</span>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:14pt;">But if I teleport to an enemy then cast Smoke Screen, the stun from smoke screen will override Teleport`s stun animation on the enemy and interrupt it, what does this mean? This means Smoke Screen`s stun has a stronger interruption than teleport.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:14pt;">The same thing goes for when an enemy is climbing over a ledge, if Ash teleports to it the enemy will act like nothing has happened and ignore it, </span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:14pt;">Itâ€™s like me fly-kicking a Rhino, the Rhino wonâ€™t budge because the impact of my kick isn`t strong enough to stagger it relating it back to Ash, the enemy strait up ignores it but the animation is Ash doing a flip-kick which the enemy should react to the impact does not which makes no sense and is not practical.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:14pt;">Also, Ash teleport has a bug where it can`t consistently open humanoid enemies to finishers (one reason why Ash needs a revisit). </span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:14pt;">Here is proof.</span>

<p>
	This is a quote from [DE]Rebecca from the Spring of 2019. Since then, several permanent festive cosmetics have been added to the game which run counter to this statement:
</p>

<ul><li>
		<strong>Spinneret Ephemera</strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Naberus Ephemera</strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Eros Wings Ephemera</strong> - NEW
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Eros Arrow Skin</strong> - Now permanent?
	</li>
</ul><p>
	And despite this, DE <em>still </em>does not offer a way for players to hide these or other silly or potentially immersion-breaking cosmetics. Nor do they yet allow some of the other silly cosmetics to be kept permanently. We're stuck in the middle with no solution for any party: people that don't like these cosmetics can't hide them, and people that do like the cosmetics that are still temporary cannot keep them. It's inconsistent and no one is happy with the outcome, including DE's creative team!
</p>

<h1>
	<u><span><span title="(Click and hold to edit title)">Peculiar Content</span></span></u>
</h1>

<p>
	DE should group these types of cosmetics under the "peculiar" label, which is already used for silly mods like <strong>Peculiar Bloom</strong> and <strong>Peculiar Growth</strong>. Peculiar items would be prefixed with a stylized flower icon (<img alt="AH1Wq7a.png" data-ratio="100.00" width="13" src="https://i.imgur.com/AH1Wq7a.png" />, a reference to Peculiar Bloom) to help identify them. This icon would be inserted into text the same way as the Lich icon used for existing Kuva weapon names:

<h1>
	<u><span><span title="(Click and hold to edit title)">Ephemerals</span></span></u>

<p>
	In addition, the Peculiar Bloom and Peculiar Growth mods are replaced with a new category of Ephemera for weapons, which are given the name "Ephemeral".

	Ephemerals are particle effects or visual changes applied to weapons equipped through the Appearance menu. Other Ephemerals can then be added to the game, like <strong>Ephemeral Dex</strong> which could change a weapon's muzzle flash or weapon trail to a Lotus symbol like Dex weapons, or <img alt="AH1Wq7a.png" data-ratio="100.00" width="13" src="https://i.imgur.com/AH1Wq7a.png" /><strong>Ephemeral Splash</strong> which could replace impact effects with the Dog Days water splashes.

	Making this change would provide DE with a new set of cosmetics they can sell or add as rewards, while also reworking and improving the existing (and widely unused) Peculiar mods. Weapon Ephemerals can be added to Liches, Queenpins, and other late-game activities, seasonal events, Prime Access, and so on.

	<em>* Some content is right on the edge of being too outlandish, and it's up to DE if the want them to be included under this system.<br />
	** Some content isn't associated with a specific time of year and would always be appropriate to view, only hidden when Show Peculiar Content is set to Never.</em>
</p>

<p>
	Content that is not appropriate to be seen is not loaded or rendered, and like in the case of skins the default skin is loaded or rendered instead.
</p>

<p>
	Note that this setting would only affect Peculiar content equipped by other players. Peculiar content you equip for yourself would always be shown on your own character.
</p>

<p>
	Additionally, some seasonal cosmetics sets like the <strong>Towsun</strong>, <strong>Day of the Dead</strong>, and <strong>Solstice </strong>sets aren't quite silly enough to be marked Peculiar and would <em>not </em>be affected by this system.
</p>

<p>
	This system can also apply to other types of content as well. For example, DE could add a spooky Nights of Naberus camera effect to missions played on Halloween, and users who have fully opted out would just see a regular mission.
</p>

<h1>
	<u><span><span title="(Click and hold to edit title)">Summary</span></span></u>
</h1>

<p>
	In this way, silly or otherwise immersion-breaking content can be unified under a single banner. Players that want to avoid this kind of content entirely can do so. Players that want to view this kind of content year-round can do so. Players who do not care either way can continue to experience the same thing they have now. And by recycling the Peculiar name DE can make space for a new set of weapon-based Ephemera to create and sell. Everyone wins!
</p>

<p>
	I sincerely hope that 2021 is the year DE finally sees the light and provides this much-needed option.

	Any change on the glass textures and intensity of the ephemera itself to make it look better would be nice, cus in the current state its not even acceptable and the frame barely visible.<br /><br />

<p>
	They look like fancy urinals.

<p>
	Could there be a toggle to use the non-prime variation in appearance please? (On a side note, same for Oberon so we can have grass as prime instead of...ferns)

	Two suggestions, more so quality of life additions than anything else.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Void Relics Segment</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Have you ever went into your void relics segment to check out how close you are to your void trace cap? At the same time, you figured you might as well check if you have a certain relic for whatever reason? Yeah, me too. Every single day I play. Great, how come when you want to make a spreadsheet of your goals and what frames/weapons you want to farm for? I've been there, and I constantly update it, but it's extremely tedious to sometimes have to circle through my void relics segment and then exit out, get into my inventory and check which actual parts I already gathered; extremely frustrating when you have to do that over and over during an assessment.
</p>

<p>
	The suggestion is simple; whenever you hover over a relic and the potential drops show up, let there be an indicator if you already own that piece. Perhaps even a number next to or inside that indicator that shows how many you have of it; would be quite convenient for a lot of us.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Arsenal Loadouts</strong>
</p>

<p>
	I might be in the minority with this one, maybe even alone; but I've always wanted to sort out my loadouts based on what type of mission I'm going to. For example, I'd have a loadout called "Defense" and I'd have Frost as a warframe, with weapons and mods dedicated to defending. Now, sticking to the example, we all know there are quite a few frames that suit defense missions; some are even designed with zone control in mind, and I quite frankly don't want to have 5 loadout slots occupied for basically one purpose with many variations.
</p>

<p>
	The suggestion here is simple as well, make config options for loadouts, just like how weapons have them. I don't care if I need to pay extra plat for it, I'm not trying to remove the necessity of acquiring loadout slots, I just think it'd be convenient to have the option to minmax loadouts for different encounters beforehand.
</p>

<p>
	---
</p>

<p>
	The way I play the game and the goals I've set for myself within it dictate that I better be well prepared for any encounter, so I'd like a way to properly be able to prepare with loadout configs; a lot of time and thought would go into it and I believe it would be enjoyable for many people who share the same need for preparation. Now that I think about it more, the void relics UI addition would help during endless void fissure missions as well. I often wonder which relic to pick when I'm merely farming void traces, but knowing what I'm actually missing when I hover over my relics would benefit me tremendously; so please consider.

	I had an idea
</p>

<p>
	I always found it really weird and well... nonsensical to have larvlings show their potential weapon in a FLOATING UI ELEMENT over their heads.<br />
	It makes no sense in-universe.
</p>

<p>
	but of course, it's an absolutely necessary feature.<br /><br />
	But hear me out:<br /><strong>Why not just equip the Larvlings with base version of the weapon too? </strong><br />
	They're already infused with Kuva by being specially chosen grineer, so why not hand them a special grineer weapon too. *cough* Bramma *cough*.<br /><br />
	then the floaty UI thing will make sense: because we're just getting a closer look.<br /><br />
	This has no farming implications or benefits, a player would see the weapon in a few seconds anyway.<br />
	And since NPCs can clearly equip weapons of most classes in Railjack (IDK about melee yet), it shouldn't need more coding for the most part.<br /><br />
	Would be really neat to get this with the corpus liches! It was the last Devstream showing the corpus larvling wielding an unrecognizable weapon that gave me this idea.
